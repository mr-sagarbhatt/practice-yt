# Web Development

    Internet: Internet is an entity which provide multiple services and web is subset of internet
    Web (or www -> world wide web): Web is a basically a system where resources(media files) and documents are interconnected with each other and we can access it using internet
    Using web development you can create multiple websites and web applications
    website: website is collection of multiple web pages with some static content (data not changed on reload, read only, minimal or no user interaction) - Ex. Wikipedia page, blogs
    web application: web application is collection of multiple web pages with some dynamic content (data changed on reload) - Ex. Linked in

    There are multiple layers in a Web application
    1.Front End/ UI -> created using html, css or js (react) -> created by front end engineer
    2.Back End/ UI -> created using php, .net, python, js (node) -> created by back end engineer
    3.Database Layer -> SQL DB -> MySQL, NO SQL DB -> Mongo db

    Basic terminologies:
    Network: A system where all devices (computers, printers, laptop, mobile etc) are connected with each other using wire or wire less
    Using network we can communicate, share resources between devices
    can exist on different scales, Ex: LAN, MAN, WAN
    LAN -> Local Area Network: Interconnected devices in one room or building
    MAN -> Metropolitan Area Network: Interconnected devices in one city or state
    WAN -> Wide Area Network: Interconnected devices in one city or state
    Internet: Inter-interconnected, net-networks, Global system connected with multiple networks, Network of networks
    IP Address: Unique identification of a machine
    If a machine is connected with network or with internet, a machine has an address from that it can be uniquely identify is called IP Address
    Browser: Tool to access the resources, documents, websites, web applications available on internet, Ex: Chrome, Firefox, safari, opera etc
    [Browser Engine](https://medium.com/@jonbiro/browser-engines-chromium-v8-blink-gecko-webkit-98d6b0490968)
    Browser Engine: To run web related applications we need browser engine
    browser engines manage a websiteâ€™s layout and also include a JavaScript engine that interprets and compiles JavaScript code

    client/ server Model:
    Client: Client is a machine (Laptop, PC, mobile, Browser, WEb App, CLI) which request(get, post, put, delete) to another machine
    Types of Clients: Laptop, PC, mobile, Browser, WEb App, CLI
    Server: Server is a machine which send response to another machine etc
    Types of Servers: Database Server, File Server, Application Server, Web Server, Email Server etc

    How client/ server Model works: For ex:
    1. client request to a server for www.facebook.com, where www.facebook.com is a domain name
    2. DNS server will convert this domain name to ip address (process called domain name resolution)
    3. request to that IP Address (server)
    4. server send response to a client

# How internet works?

Ex: Client send request to www.google.com -> DNS convert it to IP address sends request o ISP -> send request to server

history: 1960's project arpanet - aim is to send large data in small chunks(packet) from one computer to another. Developed by department of defence US - intent is to get that data or at least get some data from all
1970s - started using by organizations, institutes
1980s - started DNS/www
1990s- started commercialization- email, messaging
2000s - facebook, rise mobile phones uses

We are accessing internet through ISP(Internet service provider)
ISP - Internet Service Provider - organization which provides internet service to customers
ISP provides an IP address to customer to work on with network
We ar not accessing internet directly, We are sending request to Local ISP(ex: Using router) and ISP sends request to Internet
If destination address is not accessible by LocalC Isp, it sends to Regional Isp, and not accessible by Regional Isp sends to NSP (national service provider)
Packets: Data is divided in small chunks(packet) when passing it from one network to another
protocol: set of rules

Data is send in form of layers and travel through all layers from one user to another
EX:let say user a wants to send data through internet to user b
Layers (Protocol stack):
Application: specific to application(protocol), for ex: Gmail send mail using smtp protocol
TCP: Add Port No of application of user b
IP: Add IP address in your request of user b
Hardware: communication medium - wired or wireless

Protocols: Rules to send text, files, mails
HTTP
FTP
SMTP

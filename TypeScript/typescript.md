# Typescript ( Used for Type Safety ) (.ts , .tsx for components)

[_*Use typescript playground for example and config*_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)

    - Superset of javascript
    - Used for Type Safety which is missing in javascript
    - everything is available in typescript which we can you use in javascript and lot more
    - allow us to write javascript in precise manner so that the code faces lot less error in the run time
    - Error will displayed when we write the code (code editor gives a red squiggly line)
    - typescript is a development tool and typescript code will compiled in javascript

## what typescript does?

    - static Checking : When we write the code parser or syntax is being analyzed by the IDEs, analyze the code as we type,     checking the code at compile time
    - TypeScript actually only performs static type checking at compile-time.
    - Check the code and gives a hint that it might get error, still possible our code will run well
    - Helps to figuring out what data is processed, what data is about to comming from any resources, what data is your function    going to send out

## Situations where typescript used and we don't required explicit type checking

    - A function accepts 2 numbers
    - A function returns a string

## how typescript work?

    - typescript code will converted in javascript

## Syntx

`let variableName: type = value`

# Topics

## Type Safety

    - Type Safety is missing in javascript
    - Ex: If you add number with string value (1 + '1' = 11 | null + 1 = 1 | undefined + 1 = NaN)

## Types

    Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Void, Object, Array, Tuples
    Any, Never, unknown

# Two ways of installation (Globally | Locally)

    - Globally : For all projects | Installed in system. Used it for learning
    - Locally : For projects we required typescript config file for configuration

# Points To Remember

    Any: Don't use type Any, If possible
